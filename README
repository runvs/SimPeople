= SimPeople Project =
This Project intends to give an c++ Lib for simulating personal behaviour. 

Imagine improving the Game you are working on by a Set of really powerfull tools 
that will give you easy access to directly create, steer and extend the behaviour of any NPC in your game.

Lifeless Worlds will become filled with persons who follow their own, unique daily routine.
While being easy to use with a predefined set of Actions and Needs, SimPeople offers the possibility
to extend the API to your own demands.
